ExperienceProjectsOld,"Charlie has been working as a software engineer for over 3 years now at Bilfinger. At his current employment, he has gained experience working with customers and colleagues to design software and commission gas plants into operation. His tasks and responsibilities include establishing requirements and specifications, calculating bid proposals, developing software and commissioning gas plants. In addition to his current work experience, he is very knowledgeable with the Python programming language, having used it for 3 years, along with its various frameworks. Charlie has undergone training and finished independent projects using a variety of Frameworks for machine learning, data science, and web development. His machine learning projects has given him experience using the machine learning frameworks Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras to create various neural networks. Naturally he is proficient in using essential packages such as Pandas and Numpy involved in data science. He has used the Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework, NLTK for NLP tasks. He has a lot of experience using the machine learning frameworks scikit-learn to program ensemble models, SVM models and regression-based models. His web development experience consists of creating a portfolio website, in which he uses a tech stack consisting of Django, Bootstrap 5, Docker, Kubernetes and Digital Ocean, programmed in VS-Code on an Ubuntu distribution. Charlie has broad experience and is a great fit for the job! Charlie loves machine learning because of all the things he can create with it, he has a big imagination and he finds that imagination is the only limit to what one can do with technology. Additionally Charlie has some experience with programming languages C# and C++ from his studies. In summary he knows how to use the machine learning frameworks: Pytorch, Tensorflow with Keras, scikit-learn. He knows the data science frameworks: Pandas, Numpy, NLTK. He knows the other essential frameworks: Django, Docker, Kubernetes."
